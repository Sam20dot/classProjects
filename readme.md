# how we create class in python  
step1 :
 we write the class keyword 
 then the name of the class 
 and then  dible dots 
 # when we have constructors 
 we use the 
 __init__(self , name, req_numbers )
step3 

then we add the class memebers functions and the class attributes for the different things 


# access the class and making the objects 
objects name 
s1= name of class ( when we have consturcots we initaize with them )




# projects from class requiremets 

1. reg numbers 
2. names
3. serial numbres 

# what do we need 
1. first we create class MyClassY2ETE
 constructor machines like the database 
 # the database must be dictionary 

 # how many methods 
 # add () this will add machine 
 # update () this will update the machine 
 # delete machine 
 # getAllMachine ()
